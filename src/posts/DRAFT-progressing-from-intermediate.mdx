Created a bunch of functional, real-world applications, perhaps in multiple languages. What's next?

Everything works - but happy path is overemphasized. Maybe you have some error handling, maybe even some tests. But nothing is really formalized, and there's no real architecture. You build one feature until it works, then you build the next feature on top, and then the next.

But eventually, you start to run into some extremely hard to debug errors. Age-old programming errors, experienced by pretty much anyone that has tried to build something of sufficient complexity. You start spending hours or days trying to figure out why a piece of state that should have been updated did not, or why you're seeing data appear in the wrong order, or why refactoring is so difficult that you never want to touch old code.

So what are some of these problems caused by?

- Shared mutable state
- Race conditions
- Improper cache invalidation
- Overreliance on framework-specific solutions

Learning about these issues is best achieved by running into them yourself.

Maybe you've heard about them during the course of your learning, and perhaps even understood them in theory. But they rarely stick in this way.

The first time you run into problems with something like race conditions or shared mutable state and spend hours or days trying to figure out what went wrong with something that seemed simple - you won't forget it again.

So what's next?

At this point, it's time to step away from "just building" or learning how to do X in Y language/framework and start to explore some of the formalisms that reach across the entire domain of software development.

This isn't to say this is the wrong way to learn to code. Self-taught or no, often diving in and creating useful things before getting into the nitty gritty just is much more interesting and can hold your interest for longer. It makes some of the more advanced concepts more concrete when you've experienced the need for them.

You always remember things best when you have some foundational framework in your mind in which to anchor new ideas. And often, the best foundational framework is first-hand experience.

This is where it gets tricky. Where do you learn these more advanced concepts? There is a popular graph online that describes this particular point in learning to code as the "phase of something.."
